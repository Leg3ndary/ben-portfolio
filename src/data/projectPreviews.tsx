                To continue practicing using Tailwind and Next.js, I made a
                static website containing lots of information about an upcoming
                competition we hosted. Though there are obviously better choices
                in terms of frameworks hosting static content, I wanted to
                continue using Next.js to improve my proficiency with the
                framework. I plan to add more features and submission functions
                to the website later on. You can view the site{" "}

                I made an interpreter and website that allows you to run and
                debug a small improved string templating language that I made
                called bTagScript, I was intrigued by the static language
                primarily made popular in the discord bot{" "}

                . I thought I could not only make it better, I thought I could
                enhance the development experience for this niche language, and
                that I did. This language focuses on simplicity and quick
                programming for functions that may be hard to program but simple
                in practice.
