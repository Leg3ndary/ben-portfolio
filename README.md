## ðŸ’¬ FAQ

**1. Why arenâ€™t you using the App Router?**  
I started with the Pages Router when learning Next.js, and by the time the App Router came around, I was already too deep into this version. Rather than migrating everything, Iâ€™d rather try it out properly in a new project ðŸ’¡

**2. Can I contribute?**  
Thanks for the interest! But this project is mainly open-source so others can explore the code. Check out the [ðŸš« Contributions](#-contributions) section below for more info.

**3. Can I reference your design?**  
Totally! Feel free to use it for inspo ðŸ’… Just drop a little attribution when you can â€” much appreciated!

**4. How do I contact you?**  
Iâ€™ve got my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-zhou06) linked in the footer of the site
