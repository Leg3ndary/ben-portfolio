# Leg3ndary's Portfolio

This is my official website and portfolio, it's built with TypeScript, Next.JS, and TailwindCSS.

You can run this project as you would with every other Nextjs project or view the project [here](https://bzhou.ca).

$ cd leg3ndary-portfolio
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## FAQ

1. Why aren't you using the app router?

I started learning Next.js using the pages router, and by the time I started learning about the app router, I was already to deep in here with the pages router. I could migrate this project but I really don't see why instead of just creating another project using the app router to learn and practice.

2. Can I contribute?

Read the `Contributions` section below, this is open source purely so people can view the code behind my portfolio.

3. Can I reference your design?

Sure, please give attribution whenever you can though, thanks.

4. How do I contact you?

I linked my LinkedIn profile in the footer of my website.
